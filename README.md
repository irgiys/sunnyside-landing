-  CSS Grid
-  Little bit JS Vanilla

### What I learned

This challange reminds me of forgotten syntax

```html
<div class="title"><h1>We are creatives</h1></div>
```

```css
.wrapper-grid {
   width: 100vw;
   display: grid;
   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(460px, 2fr));
   place-content: center;
   place-items: center;
}
```

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", () => nav.classList.toggle("flex"));
```

### Continued development

I want to learn web API stuff, front-end framework such as react nextjs, and tailwindcss

### Useful resources

-  [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for forgotten syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-  [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing documentation which helped me understand web programming stuff. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
